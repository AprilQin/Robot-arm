# Robot-arm

The program uses C++ with OpenGL to draw a robot arm which has a hand, forearm and upper arm. The program animates how a robot arm rotates to grab a ball from a starting coordinate to a destination coordinate. The program takes two coordinates as arguments. One for the starting point of the ball and another for the end point of the ball. Once the program starts to run, the robot arm will rotate the joints and the hand will grab the ball. Then, the joints rotate again until the hand has placed the ball to the end location.
