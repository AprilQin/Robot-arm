# Robot-arm

Draw a robot arm that has a hand, forearm and upper arm. The program is designed to use the robot arm to animate how it rotates to grab a ball from a starting coordinate to a destination coordinate. The program takes two coordinates as arguments. One for the starting point of the ball. The other one for the end point of the ball. Once the program starts to run, the robot arm will rotate the joints of the robot arm, the hand will grab the ball and rotate the robot arm again until the hand has placed the ball to the end point location. The program is written in C++ with OpenGL to do the drawing.
